# trv-python-challenge-1

## How to Run
1. Clone repo onto local workspace and navigate to that directory
1. Run `make_api_request.py` to run program (Note: To run test cases, run `test.py` in same directory)
1. Type in city to get weather
1. Repeat step 3 or type `exit` to leave program
   
## Test Driven Development
1. create test.py file for testing code
1. create weather.py file for fetching weather

Given the user wants the weather in F for x city, when they type in x city name and press enter, the user will be given the temperature in F for x city.
